zosc
==========


Small Haskell library to work with OSC packets.

The main components are the combinators for encoding and 
decoding packets. An example "universe" datatype is included
that encodes various permitted OSC data types, but users are
generally expected to declare their own datatypes according 
to the OSC messages they wish to generate and listen for.
